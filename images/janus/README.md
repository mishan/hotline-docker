A Docker container wrapping VesperNet's [Janus](https://agora.vespernet.net/janus)
Hotline server. We use it as our Tier 3 test target for the
chat-history protocol extension (the headline reason Janus exists in
the matrix) and as a general "modern, feature-rich server" target
alongside the older mhxd we already wrap.

## Why

mhxd (`tests/mhxd/`) is the canonical-codebase reference server —
same family GtkHx's protocol layer descends from, so it's the
controlled target for base-protocol round-trips. But it doesn't ship
chat-history, doesn't ship TLS, and lags well behind on modern
extensions.

Janus is the only public server we've found that:

- Implements the fogWraith chat-history extension (SQLite-backed,
  cursor pagination).
- Implements native TLS on a separate port.
- Implements all of HOPE / large files / text encoding / capability
  negotiation as a coherent set.

Source is closed. The Linux amd64 binary is publicly downloadable
from `get.vespernet.net`, and we build the container by pulling it
at image-build time + sha256-verifying. No redistribution — the
binary stays inside the test infrastructure on each developer's /
CI runner's machine.

## Build

From the repo root:

```sh
docker build -t janus .
```

The build pulls
`https://get.vespernet.net/janus-linux-amd64.tar.gz` (~9.5 MB) and
verifies the sha256 against the value hard-coded in the Dockerfile.
A bump to a newer Janus build means swapping that `JANUS_SHA256`
ARG; we deliberately don't auto-track upstream.

Container build also seeds a few deterministic files into the
`Files/` tree and enables `ChatHistoryEnabled` in the upstream
config.

## Run

```sh
docker run --rm --network=host janus
```

`--network=host` is required for the voice chat extension (Phase 8).
WebRTC's libnice ICE path needs the server to receive UDP datagrams
whose source address the client can route back through — Docker's
default bridge strips the kernel route in a way that breaks
server-reflexive candidate negotiation against 127.0.0.1. Voice
manual-testing against a `-p`-published Janus simply doesn't work;
voice manual-testing against a `--network=host` Janus does. The
Tier 3 voice matrix runs under the same model.

With host networking, the container's listen ports ARE the host
ports — so Janus's `config.yaml` is pinned to the matrix-published
numbers directly (no separate `-p HOST:CONTAINER` mapping is
involved):

| Container port = Host port | Purpose                       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 5510/tcp                   | HTLS — main client connection |
| 5511/tcp                   | HTXF — file transfer          |
| 5514/udp                   | WebRTC voice (ICE/DTLS/RTP)   |
| 5610/tcp                   | HTLS over TLS                 |
| 5611/tcp                   | HTXF over TLS                 |

mhxd stays at its canonical 5500/5501 via the usual `-p 5500:5500`
bridge-net mapping; both containers coexist on the same host
without port conflicts.

Connect with:

```
Server:  localhost:5510
Login:   guest
Pass:    (empty)        (upstream default — empty password works
                         for HOPE login too; Janus computes
                         HMAC(key="", session_key) server-side)
```

Or as admin (full access):

```
Login:   admin
Pass:    adminpass      (set by the Dockerfile HOPE-seed step)
```

Janus's default `guest` account has `ReadChatHistory: true` already
set (access bit 56), so chat-history queries from a guest connection
work without any tweak.

## Ports

| Port (host = container, via --network=host) | Protocol | Purpose                                             |
|----------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 5510                                         | TCP      | HTLS — main client connection                       |
| 5511                                         | TCP      | HTXF — file transfer subchannel                     |
| 5514                                         | UDP      | WebRTC voice (ICE/DTLS/RTP)                         |
| 5610                                         | TCP      | HTLS over TLS — self-signed cert generated at build |
| 5611                                         | TCP      | HTXF over TLS                                       |

These match the matrix entry in
`tests/integration/server_matrix.c` exactly, since under
`--network=host` the container has no port-translation layer to
shift them. The same numbers are pinned in `conf/config.yaml`
(`Port: 5510`, `TLSPort: 5610`, `VoiceUDPPort: 5514`) so the
integration suite finds Janus without any env overrides.

## What's enabled

Out of the box:

- Full Hotline protocol (chat, PM, news, files, agreement, banner).
- **Chat history extension** (`ChatHistoryEnabled: true`,
  SQLite-backed, default retention = unlimited).
- **HOPE-Secure-Login + ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD**
  (`EnableHOPE: true`). Two paths land at a server that
  accepts HOPE login:
    1. *Empty password* (guest's upstream default). bcrypt-of-
       empty in the YAML, no `HOPEPassword:` field. Janus's
       HOPE login handler computes `HMAC(key="", session_key)`
       server-side and compares. Works out of the box —
       `test_hope_chacha20` uses this path, matching
       hotline.vespernet.net's guest configuration.
    2. *Non-empty password* via the admin REST API. The
       Dockerfile exposes the API on `:8973` and PATCHes
       `admin` to `"adminpass"`. Janus writes a `HOPEPassword:`
       blob into `Server/Users/admin.yaml`, but empirically
       the blob doesn't validate at HOPE login (likely a Janus
       issue). We seed it anyway in case future tests need
       a non-empty HOPE password and the path gets fixed.
  The master key Janus generated for the encryption sits in
  `Server/Data/` and ships in the image.
- Large-file (>4 GiB) transfers.
- Text encoding negotiation (UTF-8 / Mac Roman).
- File-mode banner (Janus ships a `banner.gif`).
- Threaded news (Hotline 1.5+).
- **Voice chat extension** (`EnableVoice: true`, fogWraith
  Capabilities-Voice.md). `VoiceUDPPort: 5514` is pinned
  explicitly (matches the matrix's `voice_port`).
  `NewUserDefaults.VoiceChat: true` gives any runtime-created
  account access bit 55 by default; the bundled `guest` and
  `admin` accounts get the bit through an in-place YAML edit in
  `seed-hope-passwords.sh` (the upstream YAML schema is one
  boolean per access bit, two-space-indented under `Access:`).

  GtkHx Phase 8 (A-E) ships end-to-end DTLS-SRTP voice against
  this container; the Phase 8.F Tier 3 voice tests exercise the
  control-channel wire shape (600-606 + 0x01F5-0x01F9 fields)
  against it. The voice tests live in
  `tests/integration/test_voice_*.c` and gate on
  `HX_TEST_CAP_VOICE`, which only Janus advertises.

Also enabled:

- **TLS** on 5600 (control) and 5601 (HTXF subchannel). The
  Dockerfile generates a self-signed cert (CN=localhost,
  SAN=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1, 10-year validity, 2048-bit RSA)
  into `Server/tls/` before the seed step (the seed-time Janus
  process refuses to start without it). Janus is the canonical TLS
  test target — `real_connect` (tls_login / tls_mismatch_rejected),
  the `real_tls_login` / `_banner` / `_file_get` suite, and the Tier 3
  TLS matrix rows depend on this. The Phase 1 client trust path
  accepts any cert via an accept-certificate stub; the Phase 3
  trust UI lands the actual pinning flow.

Not enabled (out of scope for GtkHx):

- **IRC bridge / NewsBridge / Mnemosyne content sync.**

## Iterate

To test a different Janus build, edit the `JANUS_URL` and
`JANUS_SHA256` ARGs in the Dockerfile. If upstream churns the URL
shape, the curl will fail; if the bytes change, the sha256 check
will fail — both are explicit signals.

To experiment with a config tweak (HOPE on/off, retention settings,
etc.), edit the `sed` step or add a new one. The upstream config is
~750 lines of well-commented YAML; spending a couple of minutes
reading the relevant section is faster than guessing.

## Connecting GtkHx

In the running app:

1. Toolbar → Connect (or Ctrl+K).
2. Server: `localhost`, Port: `5510`.
3. Login / Password as above.
4. Click Connect.

`GTKHX_DEBUG=proto ./build/src/gtkhx` shows the wire conversation
in the terminal — particularly useful here for diagnosing the
chat-history TRAN 700 round-trip once that lands in GtkHx.

## Known gotchas

**Per-IP connect-rate limit.** Janus refuses rapid reconnects from
the same IP with `"Rate limit exceeded"` in its log. Verified by
running the existing `handshake` integration test against a
locally-launched Janus — the first connection succeeds the magic
handshake, the second comes back almost immediately and Janus
rejects it before it can read the magic bytes.

The Tier 3 integration suite fires several connections per second
from 127.0.0.1, so this will bite us once we wire any of the
existing tests against the `janus` matrix entry. We don't see this
on mhxd because we disabled its `nospam` flag explicitly in the
config; Janus's limiter doesn't appear to have a user-facing
on/off in `config.yaml`. Three possible fixes, none implemented
yet:

1. Spread the test connections out in time (sleep 50-100 ms
   between connects in the harness's connect helper).
2. Find the limiter knob in Janus — it may exist deeper in the
   config or only via the REST API. The strings in the binary
   suggest the limit is hard-coded with a short cooldown; worth
   confirming with VesperNet rather than reverse-engineering.
3. Bind Janus's listener to a different test-client IP per test
   so each test has its own per-IP counter (overkill).

Phase D — wiring chat-history tests against this container — will
need to pick one of these. For now, manual one-off connects work
fine and the container boots cleanly.

## Layout

```
tests/janus/
├── Dockerfile               build recipe (curl + sha256 + copy + seed)
├── conf/
│   └── config.yaml          full server config (replaces upstream)
├── seed-hope-passwords.sh   build-time HOPE password seeder
└── README.md                this file
```

`conf/config.yaml` is the upstream Janus 2.0.8-dev `config.yaml`
with the test-targeted edits baked in (HOPE on, chat-history on,
per-IP throttles disabled, admin API exposed for the build-time
HOPE seeding). It's checked in whole rather than `sed`-applied
in the Dockerfile so the diff against upstream is auditable and
robust to upstream re-wording. Mirrors how `tests/mhxd/conf/`
ships its full `hxd.conf`.

`seed-hope-passwords.sh` is a standalone script the Dockerfile
invokes during the build stage. It starts Janus once, PATCHes
the bundled guest/admin passwords via the admin REST API to
generate HOPE-compatible hashes, then shuts Janus down. Lives
in its own file because Dockerfile `RUN` steps mixing `&`
(background) with `&&` (conditional) silently misparse; a
standalone `set -euo pipefail` script keeps the control flow
auditable.
