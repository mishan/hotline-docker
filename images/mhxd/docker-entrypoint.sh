# tests/mhxd/docker-entrypoint.sh — patch hxd.conf banner block at
# container startup based on env vars, then exec hxd.
#
# Variables (all optional, defaults preserve existing URL-mode
# behaviour for compatibility with the integration suite):
#
#   BANNER_MODE   "URL", "GIFf", or "JPEG"
#                 Default: "URL"
#                 "URL "/"URL" advertises a URL the client fetches
#                 itself via HTTP. "GIFf"/"JPEG" puts mhxd in
#                 file-mode: it sends HTLS_HDR_BANNER with the
#                 type but no URL, and replies to
#                 HTLC_HDR_DOWNLOAD_BANNER (212) by serving the
#                 bytes from BANNER_FILE over the HTXF subchannel
#                 (base port + 1).
#
#   BANNER_URL    URL string for URL mode.
#                 Default: https://placehold.co/468x60/png?text=GtkHx+Test+Banner
#
#   BANNER_FILE   Path inside the container to the banner image
#                 for file modes. The runtime user is `mhxd`, so
#                 the file must be readable by that user.
#                 Default for GIFf: /opt/mhxd/run/banner.gif
#                 Default for JPEG: /opt/mhxd/run/banner.jpg
#
# Examples:
#
#   # URL mode (current default; integration suite expects this)
#   docker run --rm -p 5500:5500 -p 5501:5501 mhxd
#
#   # File mode, JPEG, served from the seeded /opt/mhxd/run/banner.jpg
#   docker run --rm -p 5500:5500 -p 5501:5501 \
#       -e BANNER_MODE=JPEG \
#       mhxd
#
#   # File mode, GIF, custom banner mounted at runtime
#   docker run --rm -p 5500:5500 -p 5501:5501 \
#       -e BANNER_MODE=GIFf \
#       -e BANNER_FILE=/opt/mhxd/run/custom.gif \
#       -v $PWD/my_banner.gif:/opt/mhxd/run/custom.gif:ro \
#       mhxd

# Tracker registration target(s). hxd.conf ships with `trackers
# 127.0.0.1;` (the standalone default — harmless when nothing is
# listening on the host's 5499/udp). The docker-compose rig overrides
# this with the tracker service names so mhxd's UDP heartbeats land on
# the Argus + hxtrackd containers:
#
#   TRACKERS="argus, hxtrackd"
#
# Accepts the same comma-separated host list hxd.conf's `trackers`
# directive does (bare host, host:port-not-applicable — registration
# always targets 5499/udp; ids/passwords via id:password@host also pass
# through verbatim). `tracker_register yes` is already set in conf, so
# patching the host list is all that's needed.

# value in: backslash, the '|' we use as the s/// delimiter, and '&'

# value containing any of those — which the conf's `trackers` syntax
# permits — could corrupt the replacement or break the s/// expression.
